### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
This project uses Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. **The project provides information about popular times of travel, popular stations and trip, trip duration, and user info.**

### Files used
The code is provided in **bikeshare_2.py** file and the three city dataset files are:

* chicago.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* washington.csv

### Credits
I used this [page](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Timedelta.html
) to calculate Timedelta(s) in pandas. Also, I got a very great help from this [Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53037698/how-can-i-find-the-most-frequent-two-column-combination-in-a-dataframe-in-python) to determine the popular trips.
